This Timestamp Microservice is built in Node with Express 4.14.0. The view engine is Handlebars 4.0.1. Testing was carried out with Mocha and Expect. Version control is Git, and the app is hosted on Heroku.

Project Specs:

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
